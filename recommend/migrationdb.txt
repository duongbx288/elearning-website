The migrate command takes all the migrations that haven’t been applied 
(Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table in your database called django_migrations) 
and runs them against your database - essentially, synchronizing the changes you made to your models 
with the schema in the database.

Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, 
as you develop your project, without the need to delete your database or tables and 
make new ones - it specializes in upgrading your database live, without losing data. 
We’ll cover them in more depth in a later part of the tutorial, but for now, 
remember the three-step guide to making model changes:

    Change your models (in models.py).
    Run 'python manage.py makemigrations' to create migrations for those changes
    Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply those changes to the database.
